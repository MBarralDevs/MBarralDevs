### 🎯 What Drives Me

I'm passionate about building **secure, production-grade blockchain infrastructure** that pushes the boundaries of DeFi and Web3. After 4 years in traditional software engineering, I've fully committed to blockchain development because I believe it will fundamentally reshape how we interact with value and trust on the internet.

**My approach:**
- 🔒 Security-first mindset with comprehensive testing
- ⛽ Gas optimization for real-world usability  
- 📚 Continuous learning (currently deep-diving into Uniswap, Curve, Aave via Cyfrin Updraft)
- 🤝 Direct client collaboration and end-to-end delivery

### My next goal?
🌍 **Seeking remote blockchain engineering roles** in DeFi, infrastructure, or full-stack Web3 with flexible hours—I've learned that flexibility maximizes my productivity and enables me to deliver exceptional work while maintaining balance.
